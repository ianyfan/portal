# Portal credits in the terminal

```
git clone https://www.github.com/ianyfan/portal # clone the repository
cd portal                                       # default clone location
./portal                                        # do the thing
```

Note: this isn't perfect, so occasionally a character won't print, but ~~terrible hacks~~ clever workarounds have been implemented to mitigate this
